      <h2>About ACIE BABYY</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an artist from Pennsylvania, deeply influenced by hip-hop, but I love blending pop and melodic textures into my music. My style is about bending genres to express whatever the instrumental brings out of me. As a child, writing poems in grade school unlocked a new way to express myself, and that passion evolved into flexing my poetry around chords and beats. Lil Wayne’s ability to turn his voice into an instrument inspired me to do the same, making my music a personal journey between myself, the instrumental, and the paper. 
        <br /><br />
        During the pandemic, after gaining thousands of supporters on social media, I knew it was time to share my thoughts. I have something to add to the culture, and I’m ready to release it to the world.
